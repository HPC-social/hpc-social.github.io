After an evening coding session, we are happy to announce that the community map
([and associated automation](https://github.com/hpc-social/map)) is live!
This post will capture the screenshot of the first set of entries, which is what
we wanted to write about. This was only announced days ago (and we only have a few entries)
but we are taken aback by the (so far) geographic diversity of the HPC community!
So far with a small number of entries, we are hitting the community in Europe,
the United States, and even South America. This is awesome!

Finally, we've added a new field for a *group URL* to the map [form page](https://hpc.social/projects/map/) ! 
If you've already provided your group don't worry - we looked it up for you, but future groups will
be able to provide their group website URLs to automatically appear on the map
alongside the popup. What fun would it be to browse groups without being able
to look closer? ü§îÔ∏è

We have more to come, but this is a quick update before the break. Happy
holiday break to our HPC community, whether you eat turkey or not, do something else,
or are just using it as a glorious time to rest or do fun things. üéâÔ∏è
