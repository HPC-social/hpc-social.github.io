In this talk they share the origins of the project, the current project, and
prompt for questions or ideas about desire for the future. As a result of the talk,
the [hpc.social events](https://hpc.social/events/) page has already been refactored
to properly show the HPC Huddle community feed, and other communities that have ical
feeds are welcome to contribute their event feeds there.
