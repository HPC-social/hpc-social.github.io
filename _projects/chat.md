Although "tweets" or "toots" are a good venue for conversation, sometimes we crave something
a little more real time. Toward that goal, we support a set of community chat spaces. Since
we are experimenting and getting feedback about each of these spaces, expect some
toil in terms of change. If you want to
discuss one of these tools or suggest changes, please let us know via <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/hpc-social.github.io/issues" target="_blank">an issue</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/hpc-social.github.io/discussions" target="_blank">discussion</a>.

### Slack

<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/hpcsocial/shared_invite/zt-1mpnic8kg-CDAC5JSFkeuUQ~wJHEfCXg" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Join hpc.social slack</button></a> or if you already have an account, <a href="https://hpcsocial.slack.com" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Open hpc.social slack</button></a>

We are currently supporting this invitation link for you to use freely, and note that our moderators are watching for new community members that join to ensure that bots or otherwise spam is not an issue. If we detect malicious use of the link, we will remove it and require joining by more manual means. if you are already a member,
you should be able to login to <a href="https://hpcsocial.slack.com" target="_blank">https://hpcsocial.slack.com</a>. We can't wait to see you in the slack!

### Discord

We will have a Discord community coming soon!
