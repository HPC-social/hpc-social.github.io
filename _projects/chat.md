Although "tweets" or "toots" are a good venue for conversation, sometimes we crave something
a little more real time. Toward that goal, we support a set of community chat spaces. Since
we are experimenting and getting feedback about each of these spaces, expect some
toil in terms of change. If you want to
discuss one of these tools or suggest changes, please let us know via <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/hpc-social.github.io/issues" target="_blank">an issue</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/hpc-social.github.io/discussions" target="_blank">discussion</a>.

### Slack

<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/hpcsocial/shared_invite/zt-1mpnic8kg-CDAC5JSFkeuUQ~wJHEfCXg" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Join hpc.social slack</button></a> or if you already have an account, <a href="https://hpcsocial.slack.com" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Open hpc.social slack</button></a>

We can't wait to see you in the slack!

### Discord

<a href="https://discord.gg/gKdmwMEesR" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Join hpc.social discord</button></a>.

If your preference is for Discord, we have a small community of HPC practitioners and friends already
there. We look forward to seeing you!

> For both of the above, we are currently supporting these invitation links for you to use freely, and note that our moderators are watching for new community members that join to ensure that bots or otherwise spam is not an issue. If we detect malicious use of the links, we will remove them and require joining by more manual means. 

### IRC (#hpc on Libera.chat)

<a href="https://web.libera.chat/#hpc" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-primary btn_sm">Join the #hpc IRC channel on Libera.chat</button></a>

If you empathize with <a href="https://xkcd.com/1782/" target="_blank">xkcd #1782 - Team Chat</a>,
you're welcome to join the #hpc channel on <a href="https://libera.chat/" target="_blank">Libera.chat</a>.
It's a small, laid back group of HPC practioners and friends who prefer the quaint world of IRC.

> The #hpc IRC channel is not officially affiliated with hpc.social or any other group or project.
