Our family of <a href="https://hpc.social/blog" target="_blank">aggregated blogs</a>
aim to share ideas, news, and stories from diverse people, centers and groups across the High Performance Computing (HPC) community.
Whether you are an advanced practitioner, a developer that touches HPC, or a novice, your voice is welcome on one of our blogs. Which one to choose? You can <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/blog" target="_blank">read more here</a>, or <a href="https://hpc.social/blog/" target="_blank">browse the blog portal</a> to see posts under each category and decide which is best for you. When you are ready, you can <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/blog" target="_blank">follow instructions to contribute your own feed</a>.

> As a word of caution, for each aggregated feed in our family of blogs we curate authors at the point of addition, but do not regularly curate individual posts that are added nightly via automation. The opinions expressed on the blog are owned by the authors and do not reflect the opinion of the hpc.social community at large. Offensive or inappropriate posts should be reported to <a href="mailto:info@hpc.social">info@hpc.social</a> if you wish to report anonymously. You can also <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/blog" target="_blank">submit a pull request</a> to remove the offending feed or <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/blog" target="_blank">open an issue</a> if you are comfortable doing so publicly.


If you want some help figuring out where your blog fits, please <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/blog/issues" target="_blank">don't hesitate to reach out!</a>. We aim to be maximally inclusive and find the right spot for you.
