### Developer Stories

<a href="https://rseng.github.io/devstories/" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-primary">Browse Developer Stories</button></a>

> As developers, we get excited to think about challenging problems. When you ask us what we are working on, our eyes light up like children in a candy store. So why is it that so many of our developer and software origin stories are not told? How did we get to where we are today, and what did we learn along the way? This podcast aims to look “Behind the Scenes of Tech’s Passion Projects and People.” We want to know your developer story, what you have built, and why. We are an inclusive community - whatever kind of institution or country you hail from, if you are passionate about software and technology you are welcome!

Recent episodes that featured HPC community projects and people have included:

- [Dr. Cuff](https://rseng.github.io/devstories/2022/james-cuff/): A look behind the scenes of our beloved Dr. Cuff
