## Good First Issues

Inspired by an early [rseng project](https://github.com/rseng/good-first-issues) that would automatically
curate a list of Good First Issues from a list of repositories of interest, we combined this with
the [Research Software Encyclopedia](https://rseng.github.io/software/), and the result is an entirely automated site that
(nightly) looks for new issues tagged with "good first issue" across many thousands of repositories, and also
(once a week) adds new repositories to the set.

### How does it work?

The Research Software Encyclopedia "RSEPedia" is updated weekly from a large set of research software registries, including
(but not limited to) JoSS, ROpenSci, and bio.tools. You can see the [complete listing here](https://rseng.github.io/rse/getting-started/scrapers/index.html). When this update happens, metadata for new research software repositories is added to the RSEPedia
site, programatically available as JSON, making it easy to query this file and look for new repositories.
To learn more about the research software encyclopedia, you can [read the paper here](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.359/).

### New Contributors

If you are a new contributor, we welcome you to  <a class="link" href="https://hpc.social/good-first-issues/" target="_blank">browse the issue board</a>
and look for an exciting project to contribute to!

### Maintainers

While the repos that are present are automatically added, we support and encourage manual addition of repositories.
If you are a maintainer, you can open a pull request to [add your repository to this file](https://github.com/hpc-social/good-first-issues/blob/main/.github/repos.txt) or [open an issue](https://github.com/hpc-social/good-first-issues/issues) and someone can do it for you.
